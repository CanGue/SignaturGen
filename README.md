SignaturGen - Free Digital Signature Generator

SignaturGen is a fast, free, and privacy-first web tool for generating professional-looking digital signatures. Create your signature instantly, smooth out hand jitters with advanced algorithms, select an elegant style, and download a transparent PNG file—all without needing an account or uploading data to a server.

✨ Features

    100% Local Processing: Your signature never leaves your browser, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

    Smart Smoothing (AI-Powered): Utilizes algorithms (Moving Average, Chaikin, Douglas-Peucker) to automatically smooth out the shaky lines often created by mice or touchpads.

    Multiple Styles: Generates optimized style variations (Smooth, Modern, Elegant, Calligraphy) from your drawing.

    Pressure Simulation: The "Calligraphy" style simulates a fountain pen effect by adjusting line width based on drawing speed.

    Customization: Choose from black, blue, red, or a custom color, and adjust the pen width.

    Transparent PNG Output: Downloads your final signature as a high-quality PNG with a transparent background, ready for use in PDFs, Word, Google Docs, and email clients.

    Responsive Design: Optimized for touch devices, allowing you to sign with a finger or stylus.

    Multi-Language Support: Includes translations for German (de), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), and Portuguese (pt).

🛠️ Technology Stack

    Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3

    Styling: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN)

    Core Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (for canvas drawing, signature optimization, and multi-language support)

    Canvas Library: Custom canvas implementation for drawing, smoothing, and rendering.

🚀 How to Run Locally

Since SignaturGen is a single-page application (index.html) using client-side JavaScript, you do not need a web server.

    Save the file: Save the provided code as index.html.

    Open in Browser: Double-click the index.html file. It will open directly in your preferred web browser.

The application will be fully functional, as it loads its only external dependencies (Tailwind CSS and a custom font) via CDN.

✍️ Usage

    Sign: Use your mouse, touchpad, finger, or stylus to draw your signature in the white canvas area.

    Customize (Optional): Select a color and adjust the pen thickness using the toolbar controls.

    Optimize: Click the "Optimieren" (Optimize) button to generate and view the different smoothed signature styles.

    Select Style: Click on one of the preview cards to apply a style (e.g., "Elegant") to the main canvas.

    Download: Click the "Speichern" (Save) button to download your signature as a transparent signature.png file.
